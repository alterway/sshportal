### Installation

Packaged installation (`.deb` & `.rpm`) is privileged as it comes with a hardened systemd service and a SELinux module if you have enfored SELinux on your GNU/Linux distribution.

Get the latest version [here](https://github.com/alterway/sshportal/releases)

**Note :** by default, your package manager will automatically install `sqlite` (recommended dependency)

This installation will install sshportal as a systemd service, configure logrotate to keep 1 year of audit logs and add a systemd timer for session logs management. See [`packaging`](https://github.com/alterway/sshportal/tree/master/packaging).

If mariadb is selected during the install, it will also automatically create the `sshportal` database if it doesn't exist.

<details>
<summary>Show Debian-based distributions instructions</summary>

```bash
apt install ./sshportal_x.x.x_xxx.deb
```
You will be asked if you want to use `mariadb` instead of `sqlite` (default). Make sure to install `mariadb-server` before as the package is not listed as a hard dependency in the [control file](https://github.com/alterway/sshportal/blob/master/.goreleaser.yml#L31).

To install SSHportal with mariadb:

```bash
apt install --no-install-recommends -y mariadb-server
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive SSHPORTAL_MARIADB_SETUP=true apt install --no-install-recommends -y mariadb-server ./sshportal_x.x.x_xxx.deb
```

If you want to stick with sqlite, you just have to do this:

```bash
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt install -y ./sshportal_x.x.x_xxx.deb
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Show RedHat-based distributions instructions</summary>

Make sure to install `mariadb-server` before if you want to use it as this package is not listed as a hard dependency in the [control file](https://github.com/alterway/sshportal/blob/master/.goreleaser.yml#L31).

There is no debconf in RedHat distribution so if you want an automatic mariadb setup you need to install `sshportal` with :

```bash
dnf install -y --setopt=install_weak_deps=False mariadb-server
SSHPORTAL_MARIADB_SETUP=true dnf install --setopt=install_weak_deps=False ./sshportal_x.x.x_xxx.rpm
```

If you want to stick with sqlite, you just have to do this:

```bash
dnf install -y ./sshportal_x.x.x_xxx.rpm
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Docker instructions</summary>

An [automated build is setup on the Github registry](https://github.com/alterway/sshportal/pkgs/container/sshportal).

```bash
# Start a server in background
# mount `pwd` to persist the sqlite database file
docker run -p 2222:2222 -d --name=sshportal -v "$(pwd):$(pwd)" -w "$(pwd)" ghcr.io/alterway/sshportal:latest

# check logs (mandatory on first run to get the administrator invite token)
docker logs -f sshportal
```

</details>

---

### Quick start

1) Get the invite token in stdout or `/var/log/sshportal/audit/audit.log` if installed from a package manager :

```bash
2023/09/01 15:03:18 info: system migrated
2023/09/01 15:03:18 info: 'sshportal' user created. Run 'ssh localhost -p 2222 -l invite:6tUguNFYxeOxdx0N' to associate your public key with this account
2023/09/01 15:03:18 info: SSH Server accepting connections on :2222, idle-timout=0s
```

2) Make sure you have a ssh key pair and associate your public key to the bastion

```console
ssh localhost -p 2222 -l invite:xxxxxxx

Welcome sshportal!

Your key is now associated with the user "sshportal@localhost".
```

3) Your first user is the admin. To access to the console, connect like a normal server

```console
ssh sshportal@localhost -p 2222
```


4) Create your first host

```console
config> host create bart@foo.example.org
1
config>
```

5) List hosts

```console
config> host ls
  ID | NAME |           URL           |   KEY   | PASS | GROUPS  | COMMENT
+----+------+-------------------------+---------+------+---------+---------+
   1 | foo  | bart@foo.example.org:22 | default |      | default |
Total: 1 hosts.
config>
```

6) Add the `host` key to the server

```console
config> host ls
  ID | NAME | URL | KEY | GROUPS | UPDATED | CREATED | COMMENT | HOP | LOGGING
-----+------+-----+-----+--------+---------+---------+---------+-----+----------
Total: 0 hosts.
config> key ls
  ID |  NAME   |  TYPE   | LENGTH | HOSTS |   UPDATED    |   CREATED    |       COMMENT
-----+---------+---------+--------+-------+--------------+--------------+-----------------------
   2 | host    | ed25519 |      1 |     0 | 1 minute ago | 1 minute ago | created by sshportal
   1 | default | ed25519 |      1 |     0 | 1 minute ago | 1 minute ago | created by sshportal
```

```console
ssh bart@foo.example.org "$(ssh sshportal@localhost -p 2222 key setup host)"
```

```console
ssh bart@foo.example.org "$(ssh sshportal@localhost -p 2222 key setup host)"
```

7) Profit

```console
ssh localhost -p 2222 -l foo
bart@foo>
```

8) Invite friends

*This command doesn't create a user on the remote server, it only creates an account in the sshportal database.*

```console
config> user invite bob@example.com
User 2 created.
To associate this account with a key, use the following SSH user: 'invite:NfHK5a84jjJkwzDk'.
```

**(Known) limitations**

* Does not work with [`mosh`](https://mosh.org/)
* It is not possible for a user to access a host with the same name as the user. This is easily circumvented by changing the user name, especially since the most common use cases does not expose it.
* It is not possible to access a host named `healthcheck` as this is a built-in command.

### Backup / Restore

sshportal embeds built-in backup/restore methods which basically import/export JSON objects:

```sh
# Backup
ssh portal config backup  > sshportal.bkp

# Restore
ssh portal config restore < sshportal.bkp
```

This method is particularly useful as it should be resistant against future DB schema changes (expected during development phase).

I suggest you to be careful during this development phase, and use an additional backup method, for example:

```sh
# sqlite dump
sqlite3 sshportal.db .dump > sshportal.sql.bkp

# or just the immortal cp
cp sshportal.db sshportal.db.bkp
```

---

### Built-in shell

`sshportal` embeds a configuration CLI.

By default, the configuration user is the user starting the server for the first time. It fallbacks to `root`.

Each command can be run directly by using this syntax: `ssh root@portal.example.org <command> [args]`:

```
ssh root@portal.example.org host inspect toto
```

You can enter in interactive mode using this syntax: `ssh root@portal.example.org`

![sshportal overview](https://raw.github.com/alterway/sshportal/master/.assets/overview.png)
---

See [Documentation](https://github.com/alterway/sshportal/wiki/Documentation) for the list of shell commands.

---

### Healthcheck

By default, `sshportal` will return `OK` to anyone sshing using the `healthcheck` user without checking for authentication.

```console
$ ssh healthcheck@localhost -p 2222
OK
```

the `healtcheck` user can be changed using the `healthcheck-user` option.

---

Alternatively, you can run the built-in healthcheck helper (requiring no ssh client nor ssh key):

Usage: `sshportal healthcheck [--addr=host:port] [--wait] [--quiet]`

```console
$ sshportal healthcheck --addr=localhost:2222; echo $?
0
```

---

Wait for sshportal to be healthy, then connect

```console
$ sshportal healthcheck --wait && ssh sshportal -l root
config>
```

---

### Portal alias (.ssh/config)

Edit your `~/.ssh/config` file (create it first if needed)

```ini
Host portal
  User      root       # or 'sshportal' if you use the packaged binary
  User      root       # or 'sshportal' if you use the packaged sshportal
  Port      2222       # portal port
  HostName  127.0.0.1  # portal hostname
```

```bash
# you can now run a shell using this:
ssh portal
# instead of this:
ssh localhost -p 2222 -l root

# or connect to hosts using this:
ssh hostname@portal
# instead of this:
ssh localhost -p 2222 -l hostname
```

---

## Scaling

`sshportal` is stateless but relies on a database to store configuration and logs.

By default, `sshportal` uses a local [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database which isn't scalable by design.

You can run multiple instances of `sshportal` sharing the same [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) database, using `sshportal --db-conn=user:pass@host/dbname?parseTime=true --db-driver=mysql`.
